In this project, I was able to to carry out the following:
Modularity: I arranged the code into programmes using the 'import' and 'export' functions.
Class: The 'Person' class was used to demonstrate the definition of said classes. This was carried out in tools.js.
Promises: The 'fetchData' utilised promises to carry out asynchronous operations.
Async/Await: The 'processData utilised 'async' and 'await for a cleaner asynchronous code.
Map: The 'usersMap' shows the utilisation of the ES6 'Map' data structure.
I used the command prompt, vscode and github to carry out this project.
